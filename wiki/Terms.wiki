= Type =

Type is the template of a geometry, which is like the "class" keyword in C++ language. 

A .asmm file can be considered as a Type.

In AnyCAD, Type is not visible in the view. If you want to display the type, you need to create an Instance for it.


= Instance =

Instance is the concrete object of the Type. For example:
{{{
class Type{};
Type instance;
}}}

= Element =
Both Type and Instance are called Element.

= Parameter = 
Both Type and Instance can have parameters.

== Type Parameter == 
Type parameter is the property of Type.

== Instance Parameter ==
Instance  parameter is the property of Instance.
Instances of the same Type share the same Type parameters.
